jMetal is a Java-based framework for multi-objective optimization with metaheuristics. The current stable version is 5.10 (https://github.com/jMetal/jMetal/tree/jmetal-5.10), which is based on the description of jMetal 5 included in the paper "Redesigning the jMetal Multi-Objective Optimization Framework" (http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2739482.2768462), presented at GECCO 2015.

The current development version (5.11-SNAPSHOT) is a Maven project structured in six subprojects:
